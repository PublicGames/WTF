Let's make an open source game

## WTF - Principle

What's The F\*\*k is a full open source game. The goal of the game himself is open source !
Everyone can participate to propose ideas to add to **WTF**, implement them via pull request or better than all : propose new feature directly via pull-request !

Let's see what universe we can create when people from everywhere around the world put together crazy ideas from they imaginations !

**This repo is the root of the project.**
It will contains only this *README* for now and will be the place that will collect global issues/requests.
Create an issue to request the creation of a new repo that will be add to the project.
